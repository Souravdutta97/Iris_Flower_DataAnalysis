# Inroduction
The Iris Flower dataset is a classic dataset. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. For each sample, four features are measured: the length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

The main objective of this analysis is to explore the dataset, understand the relationships between the different features, and potentially build a model that can classify the species of Iris flowers based on these features. We will use Python and popular data analysis libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

# Insights

# This Project answared some important questions.

1. Line Plot: Plot a line graph showing the sepal length of the three species of Iris flowers. Use different colors to represent each species.

2. Scatter Plot: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between the petal length and petal width. Use different colors to represent each species.

3. Histogram: Plot a histogram showing the distribution of the petal widths. Use different colors to represent each species and display a legend.

4. Bar Plot: Create a bar plot showing the average sepal width for each species.

5. Pie Chart: Assume that the dataset represents the entire population of Iris flowers. Create a pie chart showing the proportion of each species in the population.

6. Box Plot: Create a box plot showing the distribution of sepal length for each species.
